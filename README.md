#First you have to find the rest.php file in the config folder and place it in your config folder its a configuration file for the controller

#Second find the rest_controller_lang.php in your application language directory which is also required for configuring your application

#Third find two files Format.php & REST_Controller.php in the library directory & place this 2 files in your library directory

#Fourth the controller which you choose to make your controller as RESTFUL API services you want to configure find my Api.php file which I named to use as the web services configure your controller & enjoy. Happy Codeing
